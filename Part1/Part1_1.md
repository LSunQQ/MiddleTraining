1. **Does the bug always move to a new location? Explain.**

   No. If there is a rock or the bug is face to the edge, it will stay in the same grid and turn to another direction until there is no barriers.

2. **In which direction does the bug move?**

   It is determined by both its antennae and the barriers. If there is no any barrier, it will move to the direction its antennae turns to. However, if there is a rock or it is facing to the edge, it will do clockwise rotation of 45 degrees.

3. **What does the bug do if it does not move?**

   It will do clockwise rotation of 45 degrees until there is no barrier in front of it or in diagonally of it.

4. **What does a bug leave behind when it moves?**

   It will leave behind a flower with the same color of itself behind when it moves.

5. **What happens when the bug is at an edge of the grid? (Consider whether the bug is facing the edge as well as whether the bug is facing some other direction when answering this question.)**

   If it is not facing the edge, it will move towards. If it is facing the edge(both straightly and diagonally), it will do clockwise rotation of 45 degrees until there is no barrier in front of it or in diagonally of it.

6. **What happens when a bug has a rock in the location immediately in front of it?**

   It will do clockwise rotation of 45 degrees until it can move towards.

7. **Does a flower move?**

   No.

8. **What behavior does a flower have?**

   It's color fades per step until it is black.

9. **Does a rock move or have any other behavior?**

   The rock doesn't move and has no behavior.

10. **Can more than one actor (bug, flower, rock) be in the same location in the grid at the same time?**

    No. One location can hold only one actor.
